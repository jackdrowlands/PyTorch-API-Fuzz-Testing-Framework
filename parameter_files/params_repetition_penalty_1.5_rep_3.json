API Error: Error: Incorrect number of parameter sets. Expected 10, got 4
In order to generate sets I'll need input about how large you want each number set (in total) as well.

For example:

Let each set consist (at least) three small positive integers separated ' ', followed immediately' 'by three integers separated'.so' To produce numbers just use random integers around either {range :1..num}. here num =6 )around number=4

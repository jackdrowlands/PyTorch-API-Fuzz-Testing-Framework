API Error: Error: No <parameters> tag found in the response:
Here's how you can modify the code to generate 10 unique and novel sets:

Two random tensor input values between [-50;70]  
Input values not in this range will cause an error and we should verify how it's handled by clamping them.
8 random clamp limits below[-80;-20]
This allows verification behavior for clamping above actual input value having no bounds effect.
